We're going to design a simple 3d Body to hold the [ESC](https://github.com/rosmo-robot/Rosmo_ESC#readme) & [Open core ESP32 board](https://github.com/rosmo-robot/Open-Core-M5stack/tree/main/v2.1#readme) at a ~45 degree angle [inspired by this bot](https://twitter.com/elec_leak/status/1518824409615593473)

Something like this

The design is short, We're going to design for [Pololu track set](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pololu-track-set-1?variant=39351808852051) So the centre of the wheels is 48mm

These are the components that need to be held together in a 3Dprinted structure

![Parts](https://github.com/rosmo-robot/Rosmo_3D/blob/main/V2/pololu-rough.jpeg)

It might be possible to adapt parts of [V1.1](https://github.com/rosmo-robot/Rosmo_3D/tree/main/v1.1) particularly the motor/encoder parts.

We'll 3Dprint our own wheels to be compatible with this track. 

We may do variants based on other track systems such as [Tamiya 7032](https://www.rcjaz.co.uk/tamiya-70237-link-type-track-sprocket-set-p-18901.html) or fully [3D printed tracks](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15528) in the future. Designing for the fixed length of the Pololu kit gives us most options.
