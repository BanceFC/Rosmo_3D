We're working on a new iteration of our robot body. We've spent some time researching and testing various track options.

We're going to design for [Pololu track set](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pololu-track-set-1?variant=39351808852051) 

We'll 3Dprint our own wheels to be compatible with this track. We may do variants based on other track systems such as [Tamiya 7032](https://www.rcjaz.co.uk/tamiya-70237-link-type-track-sprocket-set-p-18901.html) or fully 3D printed tracks in the future. Designing for the fixed length of the Pololu kit gives us most options.

We're going to design a simple 3d Body to hold the ESC & ESP32 board at an angle [inspired by this bot](https://twitter.com/elec_leak/status/1518824409615593473)

Later we might do a top shell to make it prettier.
