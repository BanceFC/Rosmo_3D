Approximate position of motors

Note that as we only need 3x battery, we can reduce the width by one battery to give a narrower body

I think what we need are 2x 'L' shaped motor/ encoder holders which can screw to the (narrower) chassis

I don't think this can be a single piece, as note that the motor and encoder are screwed to the inside of this part
