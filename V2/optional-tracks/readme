In addition to the Pololu tracks we would like to support Tamiya tracks

The Sprocket for these is https://github.com/rosmo-robot/Rosmo_3D/blob/main/V2/Sprocket.stl

It needs to be adapted as a front wheel with the [same size hole as the pololu](https://github.com/rosmo-robot/Rosmo_3D/blob/main/V2/Pololu_wheel_with_motor_shaft_easy.stl)
