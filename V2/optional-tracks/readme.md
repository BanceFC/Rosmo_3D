In addition to the Pololu tracks we would like to support Tamiya tracks

The Sprocket for these is https://github.com/rosmo-robot/Rosmo_3D/blob/main/V2/Sprocket.stl

It needs to be adapted as a front wheel with the [same  4mm  hole as the pololu](https://www.pololu.com/file/0J1359/pololu-track-set-dimensions.pdf)
